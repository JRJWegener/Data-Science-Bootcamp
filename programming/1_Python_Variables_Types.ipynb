        "The name you can give a variable can technically be any contiguous set of characters, but there are some conventions followed in Python and programming in general. Python follows a variable naming convention called snake case. To write something in snake case, simply use a _ anywhere you would use a space, and make sure every word is lower case. For example, `this_is_a_variable`. Giving variables good names makes your code more readable and therefore maintainable. There is a big difference between seeing a variable called `degrees` and one called `y`. You should strive to give your variables well-defined, succinct names.\n",

A common example is the use of `i` to keep track of an index. Because of its prevalent usage for indexing, it is usually easy to understand what is happening in that context when all you see is the variable name `i`. Here, the lack of descriptiveness is okay. The important thing is that the code is **understandable**.\n",
